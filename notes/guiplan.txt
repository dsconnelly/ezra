In this file we'll plan some of the layout of the tkinter GUI for schedules.

A window if width 1300 and height 900 seems appropriate. So we will start with
that. We need to show five days (we'll deal with Saturday and Sunday later).
Plus, we'll need a column on the right for metadata.

Say we have gaps of size 10 between each column and on the border. Then we have
1230 pixels of column space, which is a nice round 205 pixels for the interior
of each column.

We can draw these columns with rectangles. The first one has its top left corner
at (10, 10) and its bottom right corner at (215, 890). The next one has corners
at (225, 10) and (440, 890). In general, for i in [0..5], we can calculate
(10 * (i + 1)) + (205 * i), which is the x-coordinate of the top left corner,
and then add 205 for the coordinate of the bottom right.

However, I'd actually like the metadata panel to be an extra 150 wide, so the
total window width should be 1450.

We also need to divide the columns horizontally. Each column has 880 height. We
should cover 08:00 to 17:00, which is 18 half-hour blocks. However, we also need
a day label, so there are 19 blocks. This is not super divisble.

However, if we make each half-hour block have height 50, then the total window
height needs to be 970, which is reasonably round.
